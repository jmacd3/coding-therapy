##Background

October 30th I went in for a scheduled MRI to try and get to the bottom of some symptoms that I was having. They found a brain tumor after having a neurosurgeon review my MRI it was decided that I should immediately check in to the ER at UVRMC. I was scheduled to have brain surgery and the tumor resected. The surgery took place November 1, 2014. I am now recovering from the effects of that surgery. All things considered, everything has been going remarkably well, God has watched over me and my family through the whole process. I was actually able to get out of rehab after just 4 days (typical stay is 2 weeks). So now I am at home trying to get back to 100% which will certainly be a process. I do have some minor deficits from the surgery (which are normal and expected). Since I have been home, I have been doing out patient Speech, Physical and Occupational therapy. I only had to do one session of occupational therapy, and one session of physical therapy and they told me that I can continue to do everything else at home which is awesome. I am still doing speech therapy. I asked my boss to help give me some things to work on while I am in this recovery process so that I can continue to use my brain and recover. I'm not sure if any of these exercises will be helpful to anyone else but I decided to through it all up in a repo to make it a little easier for me to get feed back from my boss.
